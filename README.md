EIA RECS surveyed respondents to see if their household had a medical device. This medical device included those that are electricity-dependent. Examples of these include breathing machines, such as CPAP machines, respirators, and ventilators, oxygen concentrators, power wheelchairs and scooters, suction pumps, intravenous equipment, and feeding equipment, etc. 

The rising vulnerability of US households to power outages are caused by extreme weather events, which are exacerbated by climate change and old power grid infrastructure. These households need power to prevent, manage, or sustain their health. Not much is known, in the previous limited literature review, about their household's energy consumption patterns, experience with power outages, socioeconomic status, or their experience using a utility energy assistance program (i.e., helps them pay their power bills). 

The primary problems in RECS survey study are detecting who the electricity-dependent medical device households are, measuring power outage risks in electricity-dependent medical device households and understanding electricity-dependent medical device HHs' energy insecurity or resilience. Future work will be to look at CA utility programs that deploy backup, portable batteries to households.
